## Examples
#### Example 1 : Look at the graphs in Fig. 9.9 given below. Each is the graph of y = p(x), where p(x) is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of p(x)
#### Example 2 : Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x<sup>2</sup> + 7x + 10, and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients
#### Example 3 : Find the zeroes of the polynomial x<sup>2</sup> – 3 and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients
#### Example 4 : Find a quadratic polynomial, the sum and product of whose zeroes are –3 and 2, respectively
#### Example 5 : Verify that 3, –1,-1/3 are the zeroes of the cubic polynomial p(x) = 3x<sup>3</sup> – 5x<sup>2</sup> – 11x – 3, and then verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients
#### Example 6 : Divide 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 1 by x + 2
#### Example 7 : Divide 3x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 5 by 1 + 2x + x
#### Example 8 : Divide 3x<sup>2</sup> – x<sup>3</sup> – 3x + 5 by x – 1 – x<sup>2</sup>, and verify the division algorithm
#### Example 9 : Find all the zeroes of 2x<sup>4</sup> – 3x<sup>3</sup> – 3x<sup>2</sup> + 6x – 2, if you know that two of its zeroes are √2 and -√2 .
