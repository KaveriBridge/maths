## EXERCISE 9.4
#### 1. Verify that the numbers given alongside of the cubic polynomials below are their zeroes. Also verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients in each case:
* (i) 2x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> – 5x + 2; 1/2, 1, –2
* (ii) x<sup>3</sup> – 4x<sup>2</sup> + 5x – 2; 2, 1, 1
#### 2. Find a cubic polynomial with the sum, sum of the product of its zeroes taken two at atime, and the product of its zeroes as 2, –7, –14 respectively
