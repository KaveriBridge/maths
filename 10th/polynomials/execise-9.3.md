## EXERCISE 9.3
#### 1. Divide the polynomial p(x) by the polynomial g(x) and find the quotient and remainder in each of the following :
* (i) p(x) = x<sup>3</sup> – 3x<sup>2</sup> + 5x – 3, g(x) = x<sup>2</sup> – 2
* (ii) p(x) = x<sup>4</sup> – 3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 5, g(x) = x<sup>2</sup> + 1 – x
* (iii) p(x) = x<sup>4</sup> – 5x + 6, g(x) = 2 – x<sup>2</sup>
#### 2. Check whether the first polynomial is a factor of the second polynomial by dividing the second polynomial by the first polynomial:
* (i) t<sup>2</sup> – 3, 2t<sup>4</sup>+ 3t3 – 2t<sup>2</sup> – 9t – 12
* (ii) x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 1, 3x<sup>4</sup> + 5x<sup>3</sup> – 7x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 2
* (iii) x<sup>3</sup> – 3x + 1, x5 – 4x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 1

#### 3. Obtain all other zeroes of 3x<sup>4</sup> + 6x<sup>3</sup> –2x<sup>2</sup> –10x –5, if two of its zeroes are √(5/3) and -√(5/3).
#### 4. On dividing x<sup>3</sup> – 3x<sup>2</sup> + x + 2 by a polynomial g(x), the quotient and remainder were x – 2 and –2x + 4, respectively. Find g(x).
#### 5. Give examples of polynomials p(x), g(x), q(x) and r(x), which satisfy the division algorithm and 
* (i) deg p(x) = deg q(x) 
* (ii) deg q(x) = deg r(x) 
* (iii) deg r(x) = 0
