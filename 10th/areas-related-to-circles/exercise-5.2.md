#### 1. Find the area of a sector of a circle with radius 6 cm if angle of the sector is 60°.
#### 2. Find the area of a quadrant of a circle whose circumference is 22 cm.
#### 3. The length of the minute hand of a clock is 14 cm. Find the area swept by the minute hand in 5 minutes.
#### 4. A chord of a circle of radius 10 cm subtends a right angle at the centre. Find the area of the corresponding : (i) minor segment (ii) major sector. (Use π = 3.14)
#### 5. In a circle of radius 21 cm, an arc subtends an angle of 60° at the centre. Find: (i) the length of the arc (ii) area of the sector formed by the arc (iii) area of the segment formed by the corresponding chord
#### 6. A chord of a circle of radius 15 cm subtends an angle of 60° at the centre. Find the areas of the corresponding minor and major segments of the circle. 
* (Use π = 3.14 and √3 = 1.73)
#### 7. A chord of a circle of radius 12 cm subtends an angle of 120° at the centre. Find the area of the corresponding segment of the circle.
* (Use π = 3.14 and √3 = 1.73)
#### 8. A horse is tied to a peg at one corner of a square shaped grass field of side 15 m by means of a 5 m long rope (see Fig. 5.11). Find 
* (i) the area of that part of the field in which the horse can graze.
* (ii) the increase in the grazing area if the rope were 10 m long instead of 5 m. (Use π = 3.14)
