#### 1. Form the pair of linear equations in the following problems, and find their solutions graphically.
* (i) 10 students of Class X took part in a Mathematics quiz. If the number of girls is 4 more than the number of boys, find the number of boys and girls who took part in the quiz.
* (ii) 5 pencils and 7 pens together cost ₹50, whereas 7 pencils and 5 pens together cost ₹46. Find the cost of one pencil and that of one pen.

#### 2. On comparing the ratios , find out whether the lines representing the following pairs of linear equations intersect at a point, are parallel or coincident:
* (i) 5x – 4y + 8 = 0; 7x + 6y – 9 = 0
* (ii) 9x + 3y + 12 = 0; 18x + 6y + 24 = 0
* (iii) 6x – 3y + 10 = 0; 2x – y + 9 = 0


#### 3. On comparing the ratios, find out whether the following pair of linear equations are consistent, or inconsistent.
* (i) 3x + 2y = 5; 2x – 3y = 7
* (ii) 2x – 3y = 8; 4x – 6y = 9
* (iii) 3/2x + 5/3y =7; 9x – 10y = 14 
* (iv) 5x – 3y = 11; – 10x + 6y = –22
* (v) 4/3x + 2y = 8; 2x + 3y = 12

#### 4. Which of the following pairs of linear equations are consistent/inconsistent? If consistent, obtain the solution graphically:
* (i) x + y = 5, 2x + 2y = 10
* (ii) x – y = 8, 3x – 3y = 16
* (iii) 2x + y – 6 = 0, 4x – 2y – 4 = 0
* (iv) 2x – 2y – 2 = 0, 4x – 4y – 5 = 0

#### 5. Half the perimeter of a rectangular garden, whose length is 4 m more than its width, is 36 m. Find the dimensions of the garden.

#### 6. Given the linear equation 2x + 3y – 8 = 0, write another linear equation in two variables such that the geometrical representation of the pair so formed is: 
* (i) intersecting lines 
* (ii) parallel lines
* (iii) coincident lines
#### 7. Draw the graphs of the equations x – y + 1 = 0 and 3x + 2y – 12 = 0. Determine the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle formed by these lines and the x-axis, and shade the triangular region
