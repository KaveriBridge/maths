#### 1. Two linear equations in the same two variables are called a pair of linear equations in two variables. The most general form of a pair of linear equations is
* a<sub>1</sub>x + b<sub>1</sub>y + c<sub>1</sub> = 0
* a<sub>2</sub>x + b<sub>2</sub>y + c<sub>2</sub> = 0
* where a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub> are real numbers, such that a<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + b<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> ≠ 0, a<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>+ b<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> ≠ 0.

#### 2. A pair of linear equations in two variables can be represented, and solved, by the:
* (i) graphical method
* (ii) algebraic method

#### 3. Graphical Method : The graph of a pair of linear equations in two variables is represented by two lines.
* (i) If the lines intersect at a point, then that point gives the unique solution of the two equations. In this case, the pair of equations is consistent.
* (ii) If the lines coincide, then there are infinitely many solutions — each point on the line being a solution. In this case, the pair of equations is dependent(consistent).
* (iii) If the lines are parallel, then the pair of equations has no solution. In this case, the pair of equations is inconsistent

#### 4. Algebraic Methods : We have discussed the following methods for finding the solution(s) of a pair of linear equations :
* (i) Substitution Method
* (ii) Elimination Method
* (iii) Cross-multiplication Method

#### 5. If a pair of linear equations is given by a<sub>1</sub>x + b<sub>1</sub>y + c<sub>1</sub> = 0 and a<sub>2</sub>x + b<sub>2</sub>y + c<sub>2</sub> = 0, then the following situations can arise :
* (i) a<sub>1</sub>/a<sub>2</sub> ≠ b<sub>1</sub>/b<sub>2</sub> : In this case, the pair of linear equations is consistent.
* (ii) a<sub>1</sub>/a<sub>2</sub> = b<sub>1</sub>/b<sub>2</sub> ≠ c<sub>1</sub>/c<sub>2</sub> : In this case, the pair of linear equations is inconsistent.
* (iii) a<sub>1</sub>/a<sub>2</sub> = b<sub>1</sub>/b<sub>2</sub> = c<sub>1</sub>/c<sub>2</sub> : In this case, the pair of linear equations is dependent and consistent.

#### 6. There are several situations which can be mathematically represented by two equations that are not linear to start with. But we alter them so that they are reduced to a pair of linear equations.
