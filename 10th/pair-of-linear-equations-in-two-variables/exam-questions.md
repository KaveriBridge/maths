## I. Four choices are given for each of incomplete / statement / questions. Choose the correct answer and write the complete answer along with its letter of alphabet. 8 x 1 = 8
#### 1.The pair of lines a<sub>1</sub>x+b<sub>1</sub>y+c<sub>1</sub>=0 and a<sub>2</sub>x+b<sub>2</sub>y+c<sub>2</sub>=0 are intersecting lines then the ratio of their coefficients is
* A. a1/a2 ≠ b1/b2
* B. a1/a2 = b1/b2 ≠ c1/c2
* C. a1/a2 = b1/b2 = c1/c2
* D. a1/b2 = b1/a2

Solution:

## II. Answer the following questions in a sentence each. 8 x 1 = 8
#### 9. In equation x+y=7, if x=3, then find the value of y ?
Solution: y = 7 - x = 7 - 3 = 4

## III. Answer the following questions. 8 x 2 = 16
#### 17. Solve by using elimination method?
 * x + y = 8
 * 2x ˗ y = 7
 
 Solution: 
 * Adding two equations gives 3x = 15 i.e. x = 5.
 * y = 3, using x = 5 in x + y = 8
 * x = 5 and y = 3
  
## IV. Answer the following questions. 9 x 3 = 27
## V. Answer the following. 4 x 4 = 16
#### 34. Find the solution of the following pair of linear equations by the graphical method.
  x + y = 5
 2x ˗ y = 4
