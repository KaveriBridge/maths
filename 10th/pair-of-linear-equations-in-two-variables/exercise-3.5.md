#### 1. Which of the following pairs of linear equations has unique solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions. In case there is a unique solution, find it by using cross multiplication method.
* (i) x – 3y – 3 = 0;3x – 9y – 2 = 0
* (ii) 2x + y = 5; 3x + 2y = 8
* (iii) 3x – 5y = 20; 6x – 10y = 40
* (iv) x – 3y – 7 = 0; 3x – 3y – 15 = 0
##### 2. (i) For which values of a and b does the following pair of linear equations have an infinite number of solutions?
* 2x + 3y = 7
* (a – b) x + (a + b) y = 3a + b – 2
##### 2. (ii) For which value of k will the following pair of linear equations have no solution?
* 3x + y = 1
* (2k – 1) x + (k – 1) y = 2k + 1
#### 3. Solve the following pair of linear equations by the substitution and cross-multiplication methods :
* 8x + 5y = 9
* 3x + 2y = 4
#### 4. Form the pair of linear equations in the following problems and find their solutions (if they exist) by any algebraic method
##### (i) A part of monthly hostel charges is fixed and the remaining depends on the number of days one has taken food in the mess. When a student A takes food for 20 days she has to pay ₹1000 as hostel charges whereas a student B, who takes food for 26 days, pays ₹1180 as hostel charges. Find the fixed charges and the cost of food per day.
##### (ii) A fraction becomes 1/3 when 1 is subtracted from the numerator and it becomes 1/4 when 8 is added to its denominator. Find the fraction.
##### (iii) Yash scored 40 marks in a test, getting 3 marks for each right answer and losing 1 mark for each wrong answer. Had 4 marks been awarded for each correct answer and 2 marks been deducted for each incorrect answer, then Yash would have scored 50 marks. How many questions were there in the test?
##### (iv) Places A and B are 100 km apart on a highway. One car starts from A and another from B at the same time. If the cars travel in the same direction at different speeds, they meet in 5 hours. If they travel towards each other, they meet in 1 hour. What are the speeds of the two cars?
##### (v) The area of a rectangle gets reduced by 9 square units, if its length is reduced by 5 units and breadth is increased by 3 units. If we increase the length by 3 units and the breadth b by 2 units, the area increases by 67 square units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.
