## Examples
#### Example 1 : Let us take the example given in Section 3.1. Akhila goes to a fair with ₹20 and wants to have rides on the Giant Wheel and play Hoopla. Represent this situation algebraically and graphically (geometrically).

#### Example 2: Romila went to a stationery shop and purchased 2 pencils and 3 erasers for ₹9. Her friend Sonali saw the new variety of pencils and erasers with Romila, and she also bought 4 pencils and 6 erasers of the same kind for ₹18. Represent this situation algebraically and graphically.

#### Example 3 : Two rails are represented by the equations x + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0. Represent this situation geometrically.
