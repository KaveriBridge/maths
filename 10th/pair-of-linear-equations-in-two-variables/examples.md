## Examples
#### Example 1 : Let us take the example given in Section 3.1. Akhila goes to a fair with ₹20 and wants to have rides on the Giant Wheel and play Hoopla. Represent this situation algebraically and graphically (geometrically).

#### Example 2: Romila went to a stationery shop and purchased 2 pencils and 3 erasers for ₹9. Her friend Sonali saw the new variety of pencils and erasers with Romila, and she also bought 4 pencils and 6 erasers of the same kind for ₹18. Represent this situation algebraically and graphically.

#### Example 3 : Two rails are represented by the equations x + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0. Represent this situation geometrically.

#### Example 4 : Check graphically whether the pair of equations (1) x + 3y = 6 (2) 2x – 3y = 12 is consistent. If so, solve them graphically.

#### Example 5: Graphically, find whether the following pair of equations has no solution, unique solution or infinitely many solutions: 
* 5x – 8y + 1 = 0 (1)
* 3x –24/5y +3/5 = 0 (2)

#### Example 6 : Champa went to a ‘Sale’ to purchase some pants and skirts. When her friends asked her how many of each she had bought, she answered, “The number of skirts is two less than twice the number of pants purchased. Also, the number of skirts is four less than four times the number of pants purchased”. Help her friends to find how many pants and skirts Champa bought.

#### Example 7 : Solve the following pair of equations by substitution method: (i) 7x – 15y = 2 (ii) x + 2y = 3
#### Example 8 : Solve Q.1 of Exercise 3.1 by the method of substitution.
#### Example 9 : Let us consider Example 2 in Section 3.3, i.e., the cost of 2 pencils and 3 erasers is ₹9 and the cost of 4 pencils and 6 erasers is ₹18. Find the cost of each pencil and each eraser.
#### Example 10 : Let us consider the Example 3 of Section 3.2. Will the rails cross each other?
#### Example 11 : The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their expenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ₹2000 per month, find their monthly incomes.
#### Example 12 : Use elimination method to find all possible solutions of the following pair of linear equations : (1) 2x + 3y = 8 (2) 4x + 6y = 7
#### Example 13 : The sum of a two-digit number and the number obtained by reversing the digits is 66. If the digits of the number differ by 2, find the number. How many such numbers are there?
#### Example 14 : From a bus stand in Bangalore , if we buy 2 tickets to Malleswaram and 3 tickets to Yeshwanthpur, the total cost is ₹46; but if we buy 3 tickets to Malleswaram and 5 tickets to Yeshwanthpur the total cost is ₹74. Find the fares from the bus stand to Malleswaram, and to Yeshwanthpur.
#### Example 15 : For which values of p does the pair of equations given below has unique solution?
* 4x + py + 8 = 0
* 2x + 2y + 2 = 0
#### Example 16 : For what values of k will the following pair of linear equations have infinitely many solutions?
* kx + 3y – (k – 3) = 0
* 12x + ky – k = 0
#### Example 17 : Solve the pair of equations:
* 2/x + 3/y = 13
* 5/x- 4/y = -2
#### Example 18 : Solve the following pair of equations by reducing them to a pair of linear equations :
#### Example 19 : A boat goes 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours. In 13 hours, it can go 40 km upstream and 55 km down-stream. Determine the speed of the stream and that of the boat in still water.
