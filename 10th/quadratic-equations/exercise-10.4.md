## EXERCISE 10.4
#### 1. Find the nature of the roots of the following quadratic equations. If the real roots exist, find them:
* (i) 2x<sup>2</sup> – 3x + 5 = 0 
* (ii) 3x<sup>2</sup> – 4√3 x + 4 = 0
* (iii) 2x<sup>2</sup> – 6x + 3 = 0
#### 2. Find the values of k for each of the following quadratic equations, so that they have two equal roots.
* (i) 2x<sup>2</sup> + kx + 3 = 0 
* (ii) kx (x – 2) + 6 = 0
#### 3. Is it possible to design a rectangular mango grove whose length is twice its breadth, and the area is 800 m<sup>2</sup>? If so, find its length and breadth.
