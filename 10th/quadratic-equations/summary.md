## 10.6 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
#### 1. A quadratic equation in the variable x is of the form ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0, where a, b, c are real numbers and a ≠ 0.
#### 2. A real number α is said to be a root of the quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0, if aα<sup>2</sup> + bα + c = 0. 
* The zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 are the same.
#### 3. If we can factorise ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c, a ≠ 0, into a product of two linear factors, then the roots of the quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 can be found by equating each factor to zero.
#### 4. A quadratic equation can also be solved by the method of completing the square.
#### 5. Quadratic formula: The roots of a quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 are given by -b±√(b<sup>2</sup> – 4ac)/2a provided b<sup>2</sup> – 4ac ≥ 0.
#### 6. A quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 has
* (i) two distinct real roots, if b<sup>2</sup> – 4ac > 0
* (ii) two equal roots (i.e., coincident roots), if b<sup>2</sup> – 4ac = 0
* (iii) no real roots, if b<sup>2</sup> – 4ac < 0.
