#### 1. Check whether the following are quadratic equations :

#### 2. Represent the following situations in the form of quadratic equations :
##### (i) The area of a rectangular plot is 528 m<sup>2</sup>. The length of the plot (in metres) is one more than twice its breadth. We need to find the length and breadth of the plot.
##### (ii) The product of two consecutive positive integers is 306. We need to find the integers.
##### (iii) Rohan’s mother is 26 years older than him. The product of their ages (in years) 3 years from now will be 360. We would like to find Rohan’s present age.
##### (iv) A train travels a distance of 480 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been 8 km/h less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance. We need to find the speed of the train.
