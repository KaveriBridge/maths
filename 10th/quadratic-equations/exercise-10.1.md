## 10.1
#### 1. Check whether the following are quadratic equations :
* (i) (x + 1)<sup>2</sup> = 2(x – 3) 
* (ii) x<sup>2</sup> – 2x = (–2) (3 – x)
* (iii) (x – 2)(x + 1) = (x – 1)(x + 3) 
* (iv) (x – 3)(2x +1) = x(x + 5)
* (v) (2x – 1)(x – 3) = (x + 5)(x – 1) 
* (vi) x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 1 = (x – 2)2
* (vii) (x + 2)<sup>3</sup> = 2x (x2 – 1) 
* (viii) x<sup>3</sup> – 4x<sup>2</sup> – x + 1 = (x – 2)<sup>3</sup>

#### 2. Represent the following situations in the form of quadratic equations :
##### (i) The area of a rectangular plot is 528 m<sup>2</sup>. The length of the plot (in metres) is one more than twice its breadth. We need to find the length and breadth of the plot.
##### (ii) The product of two consecutive positive integers is 306. We need to find the integers.
##### (iii) Rohan’s mother is 26 years older than him. The product of their ages (in years) 3 years from now will be 360. We would like to find Rohan’s present age.

##### (iv) A train travels a distance of 480 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been 8 km/h less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance. We need to find the speed of the train.
