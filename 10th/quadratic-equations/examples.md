#### Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:
* (i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find out how many marbles they had to start with.
* (ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was
Rs 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day

#### Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
* (i) (x – 2)<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 2x – 3 
* (ii) x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2)
* (iii) x (2x + 3) = x2 + 1 
* (iv) (x + 2)<sup>3</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> – 4
