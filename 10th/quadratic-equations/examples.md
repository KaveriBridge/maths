#### Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:
* (i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find out how many marbles they had to start with.
* (ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was
Rs 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day

#### Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
* (i) (x – 2)<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 2x – 3 
* (ii) x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2)
* (iii) x (2x + 3) = x<sup>2</sup> + 1 
* (iv) (x + 2)<sup>3</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> – 4

#### Example 11 : Find two consecutive odd positive integers, sum of whose squares is 290
#### Example 12 : A rectangular park is to be designed whose breadth is 3 m less than its length. Its area is to be 4 square metres more than the area of a park that has already been made in the shape of an isosceles triangle with its base as the breadth of the rectangular park and of altitude 12 m (see Fig. 10.3). Find its length and breadth.
#### Example 13 : Find the roots of the following quadratic equations, if they exist, using the quadratic formula
* (i) 3x<sup>2</sup> – 5x + 2 = 0 
* (ii) x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 5 = 0 
* (iii) 2x<sup>2</sup> – 2√2 x + 1 = 0

#### Example 14 : Find the roots of the following equations:
* (i) x + 1/x = 3, x ≠ 0
* (ii) 1/x - 1/(x-2) = 3, x ≠ 0,2

#### Example 15 : A motor boat whose speed is 18 km/h in still water takes 1 hour more to go 24 km upstream than to return downstream to the same spot. Find the speed of the stream.

#### Example 16 : Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 4x + 3 = 0, and hence find the nature of its roots.
#### Example 17 : A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of diameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two diametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to do so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the pole be erected?
#### Example 18 : Find the discriminant of the equation 3x2 – 2x + 1/3 = 0 and hence findthe nature of its roots. Find them, if they are real.
