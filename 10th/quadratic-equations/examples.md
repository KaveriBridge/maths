#### Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:
* (i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find out how many marbles they had to start with.
* (ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was
Rs 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day

#### Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
* (i) (x – 2)<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 2x – 3 
* (ii) x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2)
* (iii) x (2x + 3) = x<sup>2</sup> + 1 
* (iv) (x + 2)<sup>3</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> – 4

#### Example 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2x<sup>2</sup> – 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation
#### Example 4 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 6x<sup>2</sup> – x – 2 = 0.
#### Example 5 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 3x<sup>2</sup> -2√6x + 2 = 0
#### Example 6 : Find the dimensions of the prayer hall discussed in Section 10.1
#### Example 7 : Solve the equation given in Example 3 by the method of completing the square.
#### Example 8 : Find the roots of the equation 5x<sup>2</sup> – 6x – 2 = 0 by the method of completing the square
#### Example 9 : Find the roots of 4x2 + 3x + 5 = 0 by the method of completing the square.
#### Example 10 : Solve Q. 2(i) of Exercise 10.1 by using the quadratic formula
#### Example 11 : Find two consecutive odd positive integers, sum of whose squares is 290
#### Example 12 : A rectangular park is to be designed whose breadth is 3 m less than its length. Its area is to be 4 square metres more than the area of a park that has already been made in the shape of an isosceles triangle with its base as the breadth of the rectangular park and of altitude 12 m (see Fig. 10.3). Find its length and breadth.
#### Example 13 : Find the roots of the following quadratic equations, if they exist, using the quadratic formula
* (i) 3x<sup>2</sup> – 5x + 2 = 0 
* (ii) x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 5 = 0 
* (iii) 2x<sup>2</sup> – 2√2 x + 1 = 0
#### Example 14 : Find the roots of the following equations:
* (i) x + 1/x = 3, x ≠ 0
* (ii) 1/x - 1/(x-2) = 3, x ≠ 0,2

#### Example 15 : A motor boat whose speed is 18 km/h in still water takes 1 hour more to go 24 km upstream than to return downstream to the same spot. Find the speed of the stream.
