#### Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:
* (i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find out how many marbles they had to start with.
* (ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was
Rs 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day

#### Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
* (i) (x – 2)<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 2x – 3 
* (ii) x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2)
* (iii) x (2x + 3) = x<sup>2</sup> + 1 
* (iv) (x + 2)<sup>3</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> – 4

#### Example 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2x<sup>2</sup> – 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation
#### Example 4 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 6x<sup>2</sup> – x – 2 = 0.
#### Example 5 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 3x<sup>2</sup> -2√6x + 2 = 0
#### Example 6 : Find the dimensions of the prayer hall discussed in Section 10.1
