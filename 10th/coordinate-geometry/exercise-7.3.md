#### 1. Find the area of the triangle whose vertices are :
* (i) (2, 3), (–1, 0), (2, – 4) (ii) (–5, –1), (3, –5), (5, 2)
#### 2. In each of the following find the value of ‘k’, for which the points are collinear.
* (i) (7, –2), (5, 1), (3, k) (ii) (8, 1), (k, – 4), (2, –5)
#### 3. Find the area of the triangle formed by joining the mid-points of the sides of the triangle whose vertices are (0, –1), (2, 1) and (0, 3). Find the ratio of this area to the area of the given triangle.
#### 4. Find the area of the quadrilateral whose vertices, taken in order, are (– 4, – 2), (– 3, – 5),(3, – 2) and (2, 3).
#### 5. You have studied in Class IX, (Chapter 9, Example 3), that a median of a triangle divides it into two triangles of equal areas. Verify this result for  ABC whose vertices are A(4, – 6), B(3, –2) and C(5, 2).
