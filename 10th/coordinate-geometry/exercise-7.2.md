#### 1. Find the coordinates of the point which divides the join of (–1, 7) and (4, –3) in the ratio 2 : 3.
#### 2. Find the coordinates of the points of trisection of the line segment joining (4, –1) and (–2, –3).
#### 3. To conduct Sports Day activities, in your rectangular shaped school ground ABCD, lines have been drawn with chalk powder at a distance of 1m each. 100 flower pots have been placed at a distance of 1mfrom each other along AD, as shown in Fig. 7.12. Niharika runs 1/4th the distance AD on the 2nd line and posts a green flag. Preet runs 1/5th the distance AD on the eighth line and posts a red flag. What is the distance between both the flags? If Rashmi has to post a blue flag exactly halfway between the line segment joining the two flags, where should she post her flag?
#### 4. Find the ratio in which the line segment joining the points (– 3, 10) and (6, – 8) is divided by (– 1, 6). 
#### 5. Find the ratio in which the line segment joining A(1, – 5) and B(– 4, 5) is divided by the x-axis. Also find the coordinates of the point of division.
#### 6. If (1, 2), (4, y), (x, 6) and (3, 5) are the vertices of a parallelogram taken in order, find x and y.
#### 7. Find the coordinates of a point A, where AB is the diameter of a circle whose centre is (2, – 3) and B is (1, 4).
#### 8. If A and B are (– 2, – 2) and (2, – 4), respectively, find the coordinates of P such that AP =3/7 AB and P lies on the line segment AB.
#### 9. Find the coordinates of the points which divide the line segment joining A(– 2, 2) and B(2, 8) into four equal parts.
#### 10. Find the area of a rhombus if its vertices are (3, 0), (4, 5), (– 1, 4) and (– 2, – 1) taken in order. (Hint : Area of a rhombus = 1/2 (product of its diagonals))
