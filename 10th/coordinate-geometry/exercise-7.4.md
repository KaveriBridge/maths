#### 1. Determine the ratio in which the line 2x + y – 4 = 0 divides the line segment joining the points A(2, – 2) and B(3, 7).
#### 2. Find a relation between x and y if the points (x, y), (1, 2) and (7, 0) are collinear.
#### 3. Find the centre of a circle passing through the points (6, – 6), (3, – 7) and (3, 3).
#### 4. The two opposite vertices of a square are (–1, 2) and (3, 2). Find the coordinates of the other two vertices.
#### 5. The Class X students of a secondary school in Krishinagar have been allotted a rectangular plot of land for their gardening activity. Sapling of Gulmohar are planted on the boundary at a distance of 1m from each other. There is a triangular grassy lawn in the plot as shown in the Fig. 7.14. The students are to sow seeds of flowering plants on the remaining area of the plot. 
* (i) Taking A as origin, find the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.
* (ii) What will be the coordinates of the vertices of △ PQR if C is the origin? Also calculate the areas of the triangles in these cases. What do you observe?
#### 6. The vertices of a △ ABC are A(4, 6), B(1, 5) and C(7, 2). A line is drawn to intersect sides AB and AC at D and E respectively, such that AD/AB = AE/AC = 1/4. Calculate the area of the
△ ADE and compare it with the area of △ ABC. (Recall Theorem 6.2 and Theorem 6.6).
#### 7. Let A (4, 2), B(6, 5) and C(1, 4) be the vertices of △ ABC.
* (i) The median from A meets BC at D. Find the coordinates of the point D.
* (ii) Find the coordinates of the point P on AD such that AP : PD = 2 : 1
* (iii) Find the coordinates of points Q and R on medians BE and CF respectively such that BQ : QE = 2 : 1 and CR : RF = 2 : 1.
* (iv) What do you observe?
* (v) If A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2) and C(x3, y3) are the vertices of △ ABC, find the coordinates of the centroid of the triangle.
#### 8. ABCD is a rectangle formed by the points A(–1, –1), B(– 1, 4), C(5, 4) and D(5, – 1). P, Q, R and S are the mid-points of AB, BC, CD and DA respectively. Is the quadrilateral PQRS a square? a rectangle? or a rhombus? Justify your answer
