## Examples
#### Example 1 : Prove that in two concentric circles, the chord of the larger circle, which touches the smaller circle, is bisected at the point of contact
#### Example 2 : Two tangents TP and TQ are drawn to a circle with centre O from an external point T. Prove that ∠ PTQ = 2 ∠OPQ.
#### Example 3 : PQ is a chord of length 8 cm of a circle of radius 5 cm. The tangents at P and Q intersect at a point T. Find the length TP.
