#### 06. A straight line intersecting a circle at two points is called :
#### 31. Prove that “the tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact”.
#### 32. Draw a pair of tangents to a circle of radius 4cm which are inclined to each other at an angle of 70° and write the measure of its length.

## 2021 Model Paper 2 
#### 11. Write the measure of angle formed between tangent to a circle and radius drawn from the centre of the circle to the point of contact of the tangent.
#### 23. Construct a tangent to a circle of radius 4cm at any point P on its circumference.
#### 30. Prove that “length of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal"
#### 33. Construct tangents to a circle of radius 5cm such that the angle between the tangents is 60°.
