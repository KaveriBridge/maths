## Exercise 10.1
1. Draw a quadrilateral in the Cartesian plane, whose vertices are (– 4, 5), (0, 7),(5, – 5) and (– 4, –2). Also, find its area.
2. The base of an equilateral triangle with side 2a lies along the y-axis such that the
mid-point of the base is at the origin. Find vertices of the triangle.
3. Find the distance between P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) when : (i) PQ is parallel to they-axis, (ii) PQ is parallel to the x-axis.
4. Find a point on the x-axis, which is equidistant from the points (7, 6) and (3, 4).
5. Find the slope of a line, which passes through the origin, and the mid-point of the line segment joining the points P (0, – 4) and B (8, 0).
6. Without using the Pythagoras theorem, show that the points (4, 4), (3, 5) and (–1, –1) are the vertices of a right angled triangle.
7. Find the slope of the line, which makes an angle of 30° with the positive direction of y-axis measured anticlockwise.
8. Find the value of x for which the points (x, – 1), (2,1) and (4, 5) are collinear.
9. Without using distance formula, show that points (– 2, – 1), (4, 0), (3, 3) and (–3, 2) are the vertices of a parallelogram.
10. Find the angle between the x-axis and the line joining the points (3,–1) and (4,–2).
11. The slope of a line is double of the slope of another line. If tangent of the angle between them is 1/3, find the slopes of the lines.
