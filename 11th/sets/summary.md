#### A set is a well-defined collection of objects.
#### A set which does not contain any element is called empty set.
#### A set which consists of a definite number of elements is called finite set, otherwise, the set is called infinite set.
#### Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements.
#### A set A is said to be subset of a set B, if every element of A is also an element of B. Intervals are subsets of R.
#### A power set of a set A is collection of all subsets of A. It is denoted by P(A)
#### The union of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which are either in A or in B.
#### The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which are common. 
#### The difference of two sets A and B in this order is the set of elements which belong to A but not to B.
#### The complement of a subset A of universal set U is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A.
#### For any two sets A and B, (A ? B)' = A' n B' and ( A n B )' = A' ? B'
#### If A and B are finite sets such that A n B = f, then (A ? B) = n (A) + n (B).
#### If A n B ? f, then (A ? B) = n (A) + n (B) - n (A n B)
