# EXERCISE 11.2
#### In each of the following Exercises 1 to 6, find the coordinates of the focus, axis of the parabola, the equation of the directrix and the length of the latus rectum.
1. y² = 12x 
2. x² = 6y 
3. y² = – 8x
4. x² = – 16y 
5. y² = 10x 
6. x² = – 9y

#### In each of the Exercises 7 to 12, find the equation of the parabola that satisfies the given conditions:

7. Focus (6,0); directrix x = –6 
8. Focus (0,–3); directrix y = 3
9. Vertex (0,0); focus (3,0) 
10. Vertex (0,0); focus (–2,0)
11. Vertex (0,0) passing through (2,3) and axis is along x-axis.
12. Vertex (0,0), passing through (5,2) and symmetric with respect to y-axis

# Answers
1. F (3, 0), axis - x - axis, directrix x = –3, length of the Latus rectum = 12
2. F (0,3/2), axis - y - axis, directrix y = –3/2, length of the Latus rectum = 6
3. F (–2, 0), axis - x - axis, directrix x = 2, length of the Latus rectum = 8
4. F (0, –4), axis - y - axis, directrix y = 4, length of the Latus rectum = 16
5. F (5/2, 0), axis - x - axis, directrix x = –5/2, length of the Latus rectum = 10
6. F (0,-9/4), axis - y - axis, directrix y =9/4, length of the Latus rectum = 9
7. y² = 24x 
8. x² = – 12y 
9. y² = 12x
10. y² = –8x 
11. 2y² = 9x 
12. 2x² = 25y
