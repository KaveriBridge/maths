11. Vertices (0, ± 13), foci (0, ± 5)
12. Vertices (± 6, 0), foci (± 4, 0)
13. Ends of major axis (± 3, 0), ends of minor axis (0, ± 2)
14. Ends of major axis (0, ± 5), ends of minor axis (± 1, 0)
15. Length of major axis 26, foci (± 5, 0)
16. Length of minor axis 16, foci (0, ± 6).
17. Foci (± 3, 0), a = 4
18. b = 3, c = 4, centre at the origin; foci on the x axis.
19. Centre at (0,0), major axis on the y-axis and passes through the points (3, 2) and (1,6).
20. Major axis on the x-axis and passes through the points (4,3) and (6,2)
