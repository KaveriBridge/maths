# EXERCISE 11.3
In each of the Exercises 1 to 9, find the coordinates of the foci, the vertices, the length of major axis, the minor axis, the eccentricity and the length of the latus rectum of the ellipse.
1. x²/36 + y²/16 = 1
2. x²/4 + y²/25 = 1
3. x²/16 + y²/9 = 1
4. x²/25 + y²/100 = 1
5. x²/49 + y²/36 = 1
6. x²/100 + y²/400 = 1
7. 36x² + 4y² = 144 
8. 16x² + y² = 16 
9. 4x² + 9y² = 36

In each of the following Exercises 10 to 20, find the equation for the ellipse that satisfies the given conditions:

10. Vertices (± 5, 0), foci (± 4, 0)
11. Vertices (0, ± 13), foci (0, ± 5)
12. Vertices (± 6, 0), foci (± 4, 0)
13. Ends of major axis (± 3, 0), ends of minor axis (0, ± 2)
14. Ends of major axis (0, ± 5), ends of minor axis (± 1, 0)
15. Length of major axis 26, foci (± 5, 0)
16. Length of minor axis 16, foci (0, ± 6).
17. Foci (± 3, 0), a = 4
18. b = 3, c = 4, centre at the origin; foci on the x axis.
19. Centre at (0,0), major axis on the y-axis and passes through the points (3, 2) and (1,6).
20. Major axis on the x-axis and passes through the points (4,3) and (6,2)
