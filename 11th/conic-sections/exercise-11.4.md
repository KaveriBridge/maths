# EXERCISE 11.4
### In each of the Exercises 1 to 6, find the coordinates of the foci and the vertices, the eccentricity and the length of the latus rectum of the hyperbolas.
1. x²/16-y²/9 = 1 
2. y²/9-x²/27 = 1
3. 9y² – 4x² = 36
4. 16x² – 9y² = 576 
5. 5y² – 9x² = 36 
6. 49y² – 16x² = 784.

###  In each of the Exercises 7 to 15, find the equations of the hyperbola satisfying the given conditions.

7. Vertices (± 2, 0), foci (± 3, 0)
8. Vertices (0, ± 5), foci (0, ± 8)
9. Vertices (0, ± 3), foci (0, ± 5)
10. Foci (± 5, 0), the transverse axis is of length 8.
11. Foci (0, ±13), the conjugate axis is of length 24.
12. Foci (± 3 5 , 0), the latus rectum is of length 8.
13. Foci (± 4, 0), the latus rectum is of length 12
14. vertices (± 7,0), e = 4/3.
