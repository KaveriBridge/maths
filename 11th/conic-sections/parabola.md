* A parabola is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed line and a fixed point in the plane.
* The equation of the parabola with focus at (a, 0) a > 0 and directrix x = – a is y² = 4ax.
* Latus rectum of a parabola is a line segment perpendicular to the axis of the parabola, through the focus and whose end points lie on the parabola.
* Length of the latus rectum of the parabola y² = 4ax is 4a.
