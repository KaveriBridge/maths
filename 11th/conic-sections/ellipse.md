* An ellipse is the set of all points in a plane, the sum of whose distances from two fixed points in the plane is a constant.
* The equation of an ellipse with foci on the x-axis is x²/a² + y²/b² = 1.
* Latus rectum of an ellipse is a line segment perpendicular to the major axis through any of the foci and whose end points lie on the ellipse.
* Length of the latus rectum of the ellipse x²/a² + y²/b² = 1 is 2b²/a .
* The eccentricity of an ellipse is the ratio between the distances from the centre of the ellipse to one of the foci and to one of the vertices of the ellipse.
