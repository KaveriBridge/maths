In this Chapter the following concepts and generalisations are studied.
* A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point in the plane.
* The equation of a circle with centre (h, k) and the radius r is (x – h)² + (y – k)² = r².
* A parabola is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed line and a fixed point in the plane.
* The equation of the parabola with focus at (a, 0) a > 0 and directrix x = – a is y² = 4ax.
* Latus rectum of a parabola is a line segment perpendicular to the axis of the parabola, through the focus and whose end points lie on the parabola.
* Length of the latus rectum of the parabola y² = 4ax is 4a.
* An ellipse is the set of all points in a plane, the sum of whose distances from two fixed points in the plane is a constant.
* The equation of an ellipse with foci on the x-axis is x²/a² + y²/b² = 1.
* Latus rectum of an ellipse is a line segment perpendicular to the major axis through any of the foci and whose end points lie on the ellipse.
* Length of the latus rectum of the ellipse x²/a² + y²/b² = 1 is 2b²/a .
* The eccentricity of an ellipse is the ratio between the distances from the centre of the ellipse to one of the foci and to one of the vertices of the ellipse.
* A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane, the difference of whose distances from two fixed points in the plane is a constant.
* The equation of a hyperbola with foci on the x-axis is : x²/a² - y²/b² = 1
