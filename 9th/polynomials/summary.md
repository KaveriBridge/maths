## In this chapter, you have studied the following points: 
#### 1. A polynomial p(x) in one variable x is an algebraic expression in x of the form p(x) = a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup> + a<sub>n-1</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup> + . . . + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup>  + a<sub>1</sub>x<sup>1</sup> + a<sub>0</sub>, where a<sub>0</sub> , a<sub>1</sub> , a<sub>2</sub> , . . ., a<sub>n</sub>  are constants and a<sub>n</sub>  ≠  0. 
* a<sub>0</sub> , a<sub>1</sub> , a<sub>2</sub> , . . ., a<sub>n</sub>  are respectively the coefficients of x<sup>0</sup> , x<sup>1</sup>, x<sup>2</sup> , . . ., x<sup>n</sup>, and n is called the degree of the polynomial. 
* Each of an a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup>, a<sub>n-1</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup>,..., a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup>, a<sub>1</sub>x<sup>1</sup>, a<sub>0</sub> with a<sub>n</sub> ≠ 0, is called a term of the polynomial p(x). 
#### 2. A polynomial of one term is called a monomial. 
#### 3. A polynomial of two terms is called a binomial. 
#### 4. A polynomial of three terms is called a trinomial. 
#### 5. A polynomial of degree one is called a linear polynomial. 
#### 6. A polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic polynomial. 
#### 7. A polynomial of degree three is called a cubic polynomial. 
#### 8. A real number ‘a’ is a zero of a polynomial p(x) if p(a) = 0. In this case, a is also called a root of the equation p(x) = 0. 
#### 9. Every linear polynomial in one variable has a unique zero, a non-zero constant polynomial has no zero, and every real number is a zero of the zero polynomial. 
#### 10. Remainder Theorem : If p(x) is any polynomial of degree greater than or equal to 1 and p(x) is divided by the linear polynomial x - a, then the remainder is p(a). 
#### 11. Factor Theorem : x - a is a factor of the polynomial p(x), if p(a) = 0. Also, if x - a is a factor of p(x), then p(a) = 0. 
#### 12. (x + y + z)<sup>2</sup>  = x<sup>2</sup>  + y<sup>2</sup>  + z<sup>2</sup> +2xy +2yz +2zx 
#### 13. (x + y)<sup>3</sup>  = x<sup>3</sup>  + y<sup>3</sup>  +3xy(x + y) 
#### 14. (x - y)<sup>3</sup>  = x<sup>3</sup>  - y<sup>3</sup>  -3xy(x - y) 
#### 15. x<sup>3</sup>  + y<sup>3</sup>  + z<sup>3</sup>  -3xyz = (x + y + z) (x<sup>2</sup>  + y<sup>2</sup>  + z<sup>2</sup>  - xy - yz - zx)
