## EXERCISE 1.5
#### 1. Classify the following numbers as rational or irrational:
* (i) 2 - √5
* (ii) (3 + √23) - √23
* (iii) 2√7/7√7
* (iv)1/√2
* (v) 2π
#### 2. Simplify each of the following expressions:
* (i) (3 + √3)(2 + √2)
* (ii) (3 + √3)(3 - √3)
* (iii) (√5 +√2)<sup>2</sup>
* (iv) (√5 -√2)(√5 +√2)
#### 3. Recall, π is defined as the ratio of the circumference (say c) of a circle to its diameter (say d). That is, π = c/d⋅ This seems to contradict the fact that π is irrational. How will you resolve this contradiction?
#### 4. Represent 9 3. on the number line.
#### 5. Rationalise the denominators of the following:
* (i)1/√7
* (ii)1/(√7 - √6)
* (iii)1/(√5 +√2)
* (iv)1/)√7 - 2)
