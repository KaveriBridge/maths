## EXERCISE 1.3
#### 1. Write the following in decimal form and say what kind of decimal expansion each has : 
* (i) 36/100
* (ii) 1/11
* (iii) 4 1/8
* (iv) 3/13
* (v) 2/11
* (vi) 329/400
#### 2. You know that 1/7 = 0.142857... Can you predict what the decimal expansions of 2/7, 3/7, 4/7, 5/7, 6/7 are, without actually doing the long division? If so, how?
#### 3. Express the following in the form p/q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. 
* (i) 0 666..... 
* (ii) 0 4777... 
* (iii) 0 001001001001...
#### 4. Express 0.99999.... in the form p/q . Are you surprised by your answer? With your teacher and classmates discuss why the answer makes sense.
#### 5. What can the maximum number of digits be in the repeating block of digits in the decimal expansion of 1/17? Perform the divison to check the answer.
#### 6. Look at several examples of rational numbers in the form p/q  (q ≠ 0), where p and q are integers with no common factors other than 1 and having terminating decimal representations (expansions). Can you guess what property q must satisfy?
#### 7. Write three numbers whose decimal expansions are non-terminating non-recurring.
#### 8. Find three different irrational numbers between the rational numbers 5/7 and 9/11
#### 9. Classify the following numbers as rational or irrational : (i) √23 (ii) √225 (iii) 0.3796 (iv) 7.478478... (v) 1.101001000100001...
