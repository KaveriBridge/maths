## EXERCISE 1.2
#### 1. State whether the following statements are true or false. Justify your answers.
* (i) Every irrational number is a real number.
* (ii) Every point on the number line is of the form √m , where m is a natural number.
* (iii) Every real number is an irrational number.
#### 2. Are the square roots of all positive integers irrational? If not, give an example of the square root of a number that is a rational number.
#### 3. Show how √5 can be represented on the number line.
#### 4. Classroom activity (Constructing the ‘square root spiral’) : 
* Take a large sheet of paper and construct the ‘square root spiral’ in the following fashion. 
* Start with a point O and draw a line segment OP1 of unit length. Draw a line segment P1 P2 perpendicular to OP1 of unit length (see Fig. 1.9). Now draw a line segment P2 P3 perpendicular to OP2. Then draw a line segment P3 P4 perpendicular to OP3. Continuing in this manner, you can get the line segment Pn–1Pn by drawing a line segment of unit length perpendicular to OPn–1. In this manner, you will have created the points P2, P3,...., Pn,... ., and joined them to create a beautiful spiral depicting √2, √3, √4, ...
