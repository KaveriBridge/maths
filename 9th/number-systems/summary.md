## Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
#### 1. A number r is called a rational number, if it can be written in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.
#### 2. A number s is called a irrational number, if it cannot be written in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.
#### 3. The decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or non-terminating recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is terminating or non-terminating recurring is rational.
#### 4. The decimal expansion of an irrational number is non-terminating non-recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is non-terminating non-recurring is irrational.
#### 5. All the rational and irrational numbers make up the collection of real numbers.
#### 6. There is a unique real number corresponding to every point on the number line. Also, corresponding to each real number, there is a unique point on the number line.
#### 7. If r is rational and s is irrational, then r + s and r – s are irrational numbers, and rs and r/s are irrational numbers, r ≠ 0.
#### 8. For positive real numbers a and b, the following identities hold:
* (i) ab a b = * 
* (ii) a ab b=
* (iii) ( a b a b a b + − = − ) ( ) 
* (iv) ( ) ( )2a b a b a b + − = −
* (v) ( )2a b a ab b + = + + 2
#### 9. To rationalise the denominator of 1,a b + we multiply this by ,a ba b−− where a and b are integers.
#### 10. Let a > 0 be a real number and p and q be rational numbers. Then 
* (i) ap . aq = ap + q 
* (ii) (ap)q = apq
* (iii)pp qqaaa−= 
* (iv) apbp = (ab)p
