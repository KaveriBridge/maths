## Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
#### 1. A number r is called a rational number, if it can be written in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.
#### 2. A number s is called a irrational number, if it cannot be written in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.
#### 3. The decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or non-terminating recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is terminating or non-terminating recurring is rational.
#### 4. The decimal expansion of an irrational number is non-terminating non-recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is non-terminating non-recurring is irrational.
#### 5. All the rational and irrational numbers make up the collection of real numbers.
#### 6. There is a unique real number corresponding to every point on the number line. Also, corresponding to each real number, there is a unique point on the number line.
#### 7. If r is rational and s is irrational, then r + s and r – s are irrational numbers, and rs and r/s are irrational numbers, r ≠ 0.
#### 8. For positive real numbers a and b, the following identities hold:
* (i) √ab = √a√b
* (ii)√a/b = √a/√b
* (iii) (√a+√b)(√a-√b) = a-b
* (iv) (a+√b)(a-√b) = a<sup2</sup>-b
* (v) (√a+√b)<sup>2</sup> = a + b + 2√ab
#### 9. To rationalise the denominator of 1/(√a + b) + we multiply this by (√a - b)/(√a - b) where a and b are integers.
#### 10. Let a > 0 be a real number and p and q be rational numbers. Then 
* (i) a<sup>p</sup>.a<sup>q</sup> = a<sup>p + q</sup>
* (ii) (a<sup>p</sup>)<sup>q</sup> = a<sup>pq</sup>
* (iii)a<sup>p</sup>/a<sup>q</sup> = a<sup>p - q</sup>
* (iv) a<sup>p</sup>.b<sup>p</sup> = (ab)<sup>p</sup>
