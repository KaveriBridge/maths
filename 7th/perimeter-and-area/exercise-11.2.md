#### 5. PQRS is a parallelogram (Fig 11.23). QM is the height from Q to SR and QN is the height from Q to PS. If SR = 12 cm and QM = 7.6 cm. Find: (a) the area of the parallegram PQRS (b) QN, if PS = 8 cm
#### 6. DL and BM are the heights on sides AB and AD respectively of parallelogram ABCD (Fig 11.24). If the area of the parallelogram is 1470 cm2, AB = 35 cm and AD = 49 cm, find the length of BM and DL
#### 7. ∆ABC is right angled at A (Fig 11.25). AD is perpendicular to BC. If AB = 5 cm, BC = 13 cm and AC = 12 cm, Find the area of ∆ABC. Also find the length of AD.
#### 8.∆ABC is isosceles with AB = AC = 7.5 cm and BC = 9 cm (Fig 11.26). The height AD from A to BC, is 6 cm. Find the area of ∆ABC. What will be the height from C to AB i.e., CE?
