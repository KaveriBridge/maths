## Summary
## Perimeter
* Perimeter is the distance around a closed figure.
* Area is the part of plane occupied by the closed figure.
### Square and Rectangle
* (a) Perimeter of a square = 4 × side
* (b) Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth)
* (c) Area of a square = side × side
* (d) Area of a rectangle = length × breadth

### Parallelogram
* Area of a parallelogram = base × height
### Triangle
* Area of a triangle = 1/2 (area of the parallelogram generated from it)
* = 1/2 × base × height
### Circles
* The distance around a circular region is known as its circumference.
* Circumference of a circle = πd, where d is the diameter of a circle and π=22/7 or 3.14 (approximately).
* Area of a circle = πr<sup>2</sup>, where r is the radius of the circle.
## Unit conversion
* Based on the conversion of units for lengths, studied earlier, the units of areas can also be converted:
* 1 cm2 = 100 mm<sup>2</sup>
* 1 m2 = 10000 cm<sup>2</sup>
* 1 hectare = 10000 m<sup>2</sup>
