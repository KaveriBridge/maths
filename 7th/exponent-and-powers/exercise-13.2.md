#### 2. Simplify and express each of the following in exponential form:
#### 3. Say true or false and justify your answer:
* (i) 10 × 10<sup>11</sup> = 100<sup>11</sup> 
* (ii) 2<sup>3</sup> > 5<sup>2</sup>
* (iii) 2<sup>3</sup> × 3<sup>2</sup> = 6<sup>5 </sup>
* (iv) 3<sup>0</sup> = (1000)<sup>0</sup>
