## Summary 
#### 1. Very large numbers are difficult to read, understand, compare and operate upon. To make all these easier, we use exponents, converting many of the large numbers in ashorter form.
#### 2. The following are exponential forms of some numbers?
* 10,000 = 10<sup>4</sup> (read as 10 raised to 4)
* 243 = 3<sup>5</sup>
* 128 = 2<sup>7</sup>

Here, 10, 3 and 2 are the bases, whereas 4, 5 and 7 are their respective exponents. We also say, 10,000 is the 4th power of 10, 243 is the 5th power of 3, etc.
#### 3. Numbers in exponential form obey certain laws, which are: 
For any non-zero integers a and b and whole numbers m and n,
* (a) a<sup>m</sup> × a<sup>n</sup> = a<sup>m + n</sup>
* (b) a<sup>m</sup> ÷ a<sup>n</sup> = a<sup>m - n</sup>, , m > n
* (c) (a<sup>m</sup>)<sup>m</sup> = a<sup>mn</sup>
* (d) a<sup>m</sup> × b<sup>m</sup> = (ab)<sup>m</sup>
* (e) a<sup>m</sup> ÷ b<sup>m</sup> =(a/b)<sup>m</sup>
* (f) a<sup>0</sup> = 1
* (g) (–1)<sup>even number</sup> = 1; (–1)<sup>odd number</sup> = – 1
