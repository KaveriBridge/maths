In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
1. A polynomial p(x) in one variable x is an algebraic expression in x of the form
p(x) = 
2. A polynomial of one term is called a monomial.
3. A polynomial of two terms is called a binomial.
4. A polynomial of three terms is called a trinomial.
5. A polynomial of degree one is called a linear polynomial.
6. A polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic polynomial.
7. A polynomial of degree three is called a cubic polynomial.
8. A real number ‘a’ is a zero of a polynomial p(x) if p(a) = 0. In this case, a is also called a
root of the equation p(x) = 0.
9. Every linear polynomial in one variable has a unique zero, a non-zero constant polynomial
has no zero, and every real number is a zero of the zero polynomial.
10. Remainder Theorem : If p(x) is any polynomial of degree greater than or equal to 1 and p(x)
is divided by the linear polynomial x – a, then the remainder is p(a).
11. Factor Theorem : x – a is a factor of the polynomial p(x), if p(a) = 0. Also, if x – a is a factor
of p(x), then p(a) = 0.
12.  (x + y + z)<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> + 2xy + 2yz + 2zx
